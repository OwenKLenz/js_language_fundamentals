**Snippet 1** - This will log The total value is 15 because the function declaration gets hoisted during the creation phase. Then during the execution phase, `var counter = 5` will reassign the variable `counter` from referencing the function object to referencing the number 5. As a result, once the 3rd line is evaluated, counter is 5 and valid multiplication will occur befroe the product is then coerced to a string.
**Snippet 2** - This example will log 'The total value is NaN'. The reason is because the `rate` variable is currently set to `undefined` after being hoisted and created during the creation phase. Now when it is being multiplied, `undeclared` will be coerced to a NaN and anything multiplied by NaN is NaN.
**Snippet 3** - This example will log 'The total value is 15'. Here, the function declaration is hoisted an evaluated during the creation phase. As a result, the `var counter = 5` will reassign the variable referencing the function to 5.
**Snippet 4** - This time an error will be raised because the function gets hoisted during the creation phase and then when `let` is used to declare a new `counter` variable, JS sees that as an attempt to create a new variable when a variable by that name already exists.
