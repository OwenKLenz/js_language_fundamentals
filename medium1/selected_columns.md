The outer loop will only run once for each item in `cols`. The problem occurs tahnsk to the use of a `length` variable declared with `var` in both loops. If `let` or `const` were used, the inner `length` variable would be scoped to the inner for loop and would simply shadow the outer `length` but because `var` variables have function scope and the can be "redeclared" with `var` a second time, the inner `length` variable actually reassigns the outer `length`  so the outer loop winds up onl iterating `cols.length` times instead of `numbers.length` times.
