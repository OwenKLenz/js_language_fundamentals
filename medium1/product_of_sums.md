It will not. Because `sum` is declared but not set to a numeric value, the first `sum += numbers[i]` will coerce `sum` to `NaN` since it currently references undeclared. Then adding any number to it will also result in `NaN` and the return value will be `NaN`

In addition, the `total` function doesn't explicitly return a value so as a result, it will return `undefined` to `productOfSums`. For the same reason, `result` will be set to `NaN` which will be returned.

A fix:

```js
function productOfSums(array1, array2) {
  let result = total(array1) * total(array2);
  return result;
}

function total(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  
  return sum;
}
```
