# Literal

The property reference `myObject[a]` will raise an error because no identifier `a` exists in the current scope. In order to reference the value at the `a` propert with square brackets, quotes must be used because a is actually a string in spite of the fact that it can be initialized more succinctly with `a: 'name'`.
