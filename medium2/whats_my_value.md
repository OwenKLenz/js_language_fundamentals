An array's length property is derived from the value of the highest integer index in the array greater than 0. It is set to that value + 1. In the array in question, it is initialized with 3 elements at indexes 0, 1 and 2. This means it has a length of 3. The other "element assignments" that occurs on lines 3 and 7 aren't using positive integer values (they instead use "indexes" of a float and a negative integer). As a result, those wind up being key-value pairs in the Array object instead of indexed values. This means that the length never changes.

the indexes and the keys associated with each new property are all returned by the `Object.keys` method, so the lengths logged on lines 5 and 9 will increase accordingly (4 and 5).
